# Tutorial Knowledge Engineering for Hybrid Intelligence (KE4HI)


The second Knowledge Engineering for Hybrid Intelligence (HIKE) tutorial will be held in conjunction with the 14TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON FORMAL ONTOLOGY IN INFORMATION SYSTEMS (FOIS 2024)
08-09 July 2024 (online) and 15-19 July 2024 (Enschede, Netherlands)


## Description
Hybrid Intelligence (HI) is a rapidly growing field aiming at creating collaborative systems where humans and intelligent machines synergetically cooperate in mixed teams
towards shared goals. A clear characterization of the tasks and knowledge exchanged by
the agents in HI applications is still missing, hampering both standardization and reuse
when designing new HI systems.
Knowledge Engineering (KE) methods have been used to solve such issue through
the formalization of tasks and roles in knowledge-intensive processes, formerly often
for Expert Systems. In this tutorial we will introduce how KE methods can be applied
to HI scenarios, and specifically how common, reusable elements such as knowledge
roles, tasks and subtasks can be identified in contexts where symbolic, subsymbolic and
human-in-the-loop components are involved.
In this tutorial we will first introduce the well-known CommonKADS methodology,
and recent extensions to make it usable to hybrid scenarios. In a hands-on part, we will
then use this methodology to analyze HI projects and identify common tasks.
